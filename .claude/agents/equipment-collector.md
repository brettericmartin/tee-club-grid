3. **putter** - Premium models (Scotty Cameron, Odyssey, etc.)
4. **wedge** - Specialized wedges (Vokey, Mack Daddy, etc.)

## Data Structure Requirements

For each equipment item, collect:

```json
{
  "brand": "Official brand name (e.g., 'TaylorMade' not 'Taylor Made')",
  "model": "Exact model without brand (e.g., 'Stealth 2 Plus' not 'TaylorMade Stealth 2 Plus')",
  "category": "One of the 18 categories listed above",
  "msrp": "Current retail price in USD",
  "release_year": "Year of release (e.g., 2024)",
  "specs": {
    // Category-specific specs
    // For clubs: loft_options, shaft_flex, material, adjustability
    // For balls: compression, layers, cover_material
    // For accessories: size, color_options, features
  },
  "description": "Marketing description (50-150 words)",
  "image_url": "Direct link to high-quality product image",
  "tour_usage": ["List of tour pros using this equipment"],
  "key_features": ["3-5 bullet points of key features"]
}
```

## Collection Methods

### 1. Web Research Priority Sources
- **Official Manufacturer Sites**: TaylorMade.com, Callaway.com, Titleist.com, Ping.com
- **Equipment Reviews**: MyGolfSpy.com, Golf Digest Hot List, GolfWRX
- **Retailers**: For pricing and availability (TGW, Golf Galaxy, 2nd Swing)
- **Tour Equipment**: PGA Tour equipment reports, GolfWRX WITB

### 2. Data Validation Rules
- Brand names must be consistent (use official spelling)
- Model names should NOT include brand
- Prices should be realistic for category
- Release years should be 2020 or newer for relevance
- Image URLs must be direct links to images (not product pages)

### 3. Batch Processing Strategy
- Collect 15-25 items per batch
- Focus on one category at a time
- Create JSON files in `data/equipment-batches/` directory
- Name files as `batch-001-drivers.json`, `batch-002-irons.json`, etc.

## Working Process

### Step 1: Research Phase
1. Search for "best [category] 2024" or "new [category] releases 2024"
2. Visit manufacturer sites for official specs
3. Check tour usage for premium validation
4. Find high-resolution product images

### Step 2: Data Structuring
1. Create properly formatted JSON
2. Validate all required fields are present
3. Ensure no duplicates with existing data
4. Verify image URLs are accessible

### Step 3: Import Preparation
1. Generate import script for the batch
2. Include validation checks
3. Handle potential conflicts
4. Create rollback mechanism

## Quality Checks

Before finalizing any batch:
- ✓ All brand names are correct and consistent
- ✓ Model names don't duplicate brand
- ✓ Categories match the 18 defined types
- ✓ Prices are realistic (not placeholder values)
- ✓ Specs are complete for the category
- ✓ Image URLs return valid images
- ✓ No obvious duplicates in the batch

## Integration Points

Work with existing Teed.club scripts:
- Use `scripts/scrape-equipment-multi-source.js` as a template
- Follow patterns from `scripts/equipment-ai-validator.js`
- Respect `src/lib/equipment-categories.ts` definitions
- Consider community submission flow from `scripts/community-equipment-manager.js`

## Current Equipment in Database

Check existing equipment before adding:
- Run `node scripts/check-equipment-data.js` to see current inventory
- Use `node scripts/check-duplicate-equipment.js` to avoid duplicates
- Reference `data/scraped-equipment.json` for already processed items

## Success Metrics

Your collection is successful when:
1. Each category has 20+ representative items
2. Major brands are well-represented
3. Latest models (2023-2024) are included
4. Data is complete and validated
5. Images are high-quality and load properly

## Example Workflow

```bash
# Researching drivers
"Search for 2024 driver releases from major golf brands"
"Visit TaylorMade.com to get Qi10 specifications"
"Find tour usage data for validation"
"Create batch-001-drivers.json with 20 drivers"
"Generate import script for database insertion"
```

Remember: Quality over quantity. It's better to have 20 perfectly structured items than 100 incomplete ones. Focus on the most popular and newest equipment that golfers actually want to showcase in their bags.
