## Error Analysis üîç

### Console Errors (Recurring)
1. **"Error fetching beta summary"** - Appears on every page load
   - Likely missing API endpoint or authentication issue
   - May be blocking user access checks

2. **400 Bad Request** - Server rejecting requests
   - Could indicate RLS policy issues
   - May be why data isn't loading

### Missing Elements Analysis
The selectors are looking for elements that don't exist, suggesting:
- Components may not be rendering
- Data fetching is failing silently
- RLS policies may be blocking all data access

---

## Root Cause Analysis

### Primary Issue: Data Access Layer Failure
All evidence points to a **complete data access failure**:

1. **No data displaying anywhere** - Equipment, bags, feed all empty
2. **Beta summary fetch failing** - Authentication/authorization broken
3. **400 errors** - Server rejecting data requests

### Likely Cause: RLS Policy Misconfiguration
Based on the symptoms:
- Anonymous users cannot read ANY data
- Authenticated user detection is failing
- Beta access check is erroring out

---

## Recommended Fixes (Priority Order)

### üî¥ CRITICAL - Fix Immediately

1. **Fix Beta Summary API**
   ```javascript
   // Check /api/beta/summary.ts endpoint
   // Ensure it handles anonymous users gracefully
   // Should return { hasBetaAccess: false } not error
   ```

2. **Verify RLS Policies Allow Anonymous Read**
   ```sql
   -- Run the master RLS fix
   -- /supabase/migrations/20250110_master_rls_policies.sql
   ```

3. **Fix Equipment Loading**
   - Check equipment table RLS allows public SELECT
   - Verify equipment_photos table is accessible
   - Test equipment API endpoints

4. **Fix Authentication Flow**
   - Add visible Sign In/Sign Up buttons to landing page
   - Ensure auth redirects work properly
   - Fix beta access check

### üü° HIGH PRIORITY

5. **Fix Feed System**
   - Ensure feed_posts table has public read access
   - Check feed_likes table policies
   - Verify feed API is working

6. **Fix Bag Display**
   - Check user_bags table RLS (public bags should be visible)
   - Verify bag_equipment join queries work
   - Test bag API endpoints

### üü¢ MEDIUM PRIORITY

7. **Mobile Responsiveness**
   - Add hamburger menu for mobile
   - Test all pages at mobile breakpoints
   - Ensure touch targets are adequate

8. **UI Polish**
   - Add Get Started CTA to landing page
   - Improve error states (show "No equipment found" vs blank)
   - Add loading states while data fetches

---

## Testing Recommendations

### Immediate Actions
1. **Run RLS verification**: `node scripts/verify-all-rls.js`
2. **Check Supabase logs** for specific RLS policy violations
3. **Test with authenticated user** to isolate anonymous vs auth issues

### Ongoing Testing
- Set up automated tests to run on each deployment
- Monitor error rates in production
- Add health check endpoints for critical features

---

## Conclusion

The site has severe data access issues that completely break core functionality. **This is a critical P0 issue** that makes the site unusable. The good news is that the frontend appears to be working - it's just not getting any data.

**Recommended immediate action**: 
1. Apply the comprehensive RLS fix
2. Fix the beta summary endpoint
3. Verify data is loading
4. Re-run tests to confirm fixes

The site cannot go live or be used by real users until these issues are resolved.
