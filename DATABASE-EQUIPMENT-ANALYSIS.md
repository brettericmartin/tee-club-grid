| accessories | 2 | 0.2% |
| tee | 1 | 0.1% |

## Data Quality Assessment

### ✅ Strengths
- **100% brand and model completion** - No missing core identifiers
- **100% specs data coverage** - All items have specification data
- **Comprehensive equipment coverage** - Good representation across all golf equipment categories
- **Structured specs format** - JSON specs follow category-specific patterns

### ⚠️ Areas for Improvement

#### 1. Category Standardization Issues
- **Inconsistent naming**: "fairway_wood" uses underscore while others use hyphens
- **Duplicate categories**: "ball"/"balls" and "bag"/"bags" should be consolidated
- **Category variations**: "fairway" vs "fairway_wood" may represent the same equipment type

#### 2. Image Coverage Gap
- **45.7% missing images** (413 items with empty image_url)
- Critical for user experience and equipment identification
- Examples of missing images:
  - REDTIGER 1200 yards rangefinder
  - Various TaylorMade and Callaway equipment
  - Shaft and grip accessories

#### 3. Specs Data Inconsistencies
- **Empty specs objects**: Some items have `{}` instead of structured data
- **Inconsistent field usage**: Not all items in same category have same spec fields
- **Missing standardization**: No enforced schema per category

## Specs Data Analysis by Category

### Driver Specifications (7 samples analyzed)

- `loft_options`: ["8°", "9°", "10.5°", "12°"]
- `shaft_options`: ["Regular", "Stiff", "X-Stiff"]
- `adjustable`: true/false
- `year`: Release year

### Iron Specifications (5 samples analyzed)
**Common fields (80%+ usage):**
- `set_makeup`: "4-PW or 5-PW"
- `shaft_options`: ["Regular", "Stiff", "X-Stiff"]
- `shaft_material`: ["Steel", "Graphite"]
- `year`: Release year

### Wedge Specifications (1 sample analyzed)
**Standard fields:**
- `loft_options`: ["46°", "50°", "52°", "54°", "56°", "58°", "60°"]
- `grind_options`: ["Standard", "Full", "Low"]
- `bounce_options`: ["Low", "Mid", "High"]
- `year`: Release year

### Accessory Categories
- **Balls**: compression, pieces, spin characteristics
- **Shafts**: flex, weight, launch/spin profiles
- **Grips**: material, size, weight specifications
- **GPS/Rangefinders**: battery life, range, features

## Recommendations

### 🎯 Priority 1: Category Standardization
1. **Consolidate duplicate categories:**
   - Merge "ball" and "balls" → "ball"
   - Merge "bag" and "bags" → "bag"
2. **Standardize naming convention:**
   - Change "fairway_wood" → "fairway-wood"
   - Review "fairway" vs "fairway-wood" distinction
3. **Implement category validation** to prevent future inconsistencies

### 🎯 Priority 2: Image Coverage
1. **Source missing images** for 413 items (45.7%)
2. **Prioritize high-visibility categories:**
   - Drivers, irons, putters (core equipment)
   - Popular brands (TaylorMade, Callaway, Titleist)
3. **Implement image validation** for future additions

### 🎯 Priority 3: Specs Schema Standardization
1. **Define standard specs schema per category:**
   ```json
   // Driver example
   {
     "year": 2024,
     "adjustable": true,
     "loft_options": ["8°", "9°", "10.5°", "12°"],
     "shaft_options": ["Regular", "Stiff", "X-Stiff"],
     "head_size": "460cc"
   }
   ```
2. **Fill empty specs objects** with appropriate data
3. **Implement specs validation** for data consistency

### 🎯 Priority 4: Enhanced Data Features
1. **Professional tour usage tracking**
2. **MSRP and current market pricing**
3. **Equipment performance ratings/reviews**
4. **Release date tracking**
5. **Equipment relationship mapping** (shaft/grip compatibility)

## Data Integrity Status

- ✅ **No duplicate entries detected** based on brand+model+category combinations
- ✅ **All required fields populated** (brand, model, category)
- ✅ **Proper UUID structure** for all IDs
- ✅ **Consistent timestamp format** for created_at

## Next Steps

1. **Immediate**: Fix category naming inconsistencies
2. **Short-term**: Source and upload missing product images
3. **Medium-term**: Implement standardized specs schemas
4. **Long-term**: Add enhanced equipment data features
