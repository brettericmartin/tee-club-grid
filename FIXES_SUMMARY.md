# Summary of Fixes

## 1. Text Box Retention When Adding New Brand/Model

### Problem
When clicking "Add New Brand" or "Add New Model" in the equipment submission dialog, the search text was cleared, losing what the user had typed.

### Solution
- **SubmitEquipmentModal.tsx**: 
  - When clicking "Add New Brand", the search text is now copied to the brand field
  - When clicking "Add New Model", the search text is now copied to the model field
  - When canceling, the text is restored to the search box
  - User's input is preserved throughout the flow

## 2. Equipment Photo Saving and Syncing

### Problem
Photos uploaded when creating new equipment weren't being saved to the central photo hub or appearing in feed posts.

### Solution
- **communityEquipment.ts**:
  - Added import for `syncUserPhotoToEquipment` and `createEquipmentPhotoFeedPost`
  - After successfully creating equipment with a photo:
    - Photo is synced to the `equipment_photos` table (central gallery)
    - Feed post is created to share the new equipment
  - Errors in syncing don't fail the equipment submission

- **Equipment.tsx**:
  - Replaced TODO with actual implementation
  - Now properly calls `submitEquipment` service
  - Handles success/error cases appropriately
  - Refreshes equipment list when new items match current filters

## Results
1. ✅ Users no longer lose their typed text when adding new brands/models
2. ✅ Equipment photos are properly saved to all necessary tables
3. ✅ Feed posts are created when new equipment is added with photos
4. ✅ Equipment submission works consistently across all entry points
5. ✅ Photos appear in equipment galleries and user feeds as expected

## Technical Details
- No database schema changes required
- All changes are backward compatible
- Error handling ensures partial failures don't break the flow
- TypeScript compilation verified with no errors
