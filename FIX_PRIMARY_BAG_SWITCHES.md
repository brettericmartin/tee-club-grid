# Fix Primary Bag Switch Functionality

## The Issue
The toggle switches have been implemented but the primary bag switching isn't working correctly because database triggers are interfering with the application logic.

## Solution
Run the SQL script to disable the conflicting triggers:

1. Go to your Supabase Dashboard
2. Navigate to SQL Editor
3. Copy and paste the contents of: `sql/disable-primary-bag-triggers.sql`
4. Click "Run"

## What This Does
- Removes database triggers that were auto-setting bags as primary
- Allows the application code to handle primary bag logic correctly
- Fixes the issue where switches don't properly toggle

## After Running the SQL
The switch functionality will work as expected:
- Toggle ON (right) = Set as primary bag
- Other bags automatically toggle OFF when one is toggled ON
- Clean visual feedback with the horizontal switch UI

## UI Changes Made
1. **BagSelectorDialog**: Replaced star icons with toggle switches
2. **MyBagSupabase**: Replaced star button with toggle switch
3. Both components now use the Switch component from the UI library

The switches provide better visual feedback and are more intuitive than the star system.
