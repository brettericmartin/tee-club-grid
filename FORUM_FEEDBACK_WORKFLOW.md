  - Database: `user_follows` table (follower_id, following_id)
  - Add follow button to ProfileDialog component

```

**Solution:**
- Reposition share button for mobile

### 4. Share Bag Needs Better Format
**Priority:** MEDIUM - Enhancement  
**Issue:** Need screenshot-friendly bag card and list view for sharing

```bash
# Create shareable bag views
# Components: BagShareCard, BagListView
```

**Solution:**
- Create dedicated share view with:
  - Clean bag card without UI controls
  - List view of all equipment
  - Watermark/attribution (teed.club)
  - Download as image option
  - Copy link functionality

**Implementation:**
- New route: `/bag/[id]/share`

### 5. Bag Card Tees Not Working
**Priority:** CRITICAL - Core functionality broken  
**Issue:** Tee/untee functionality not working on bag cards  

**Steps to Fix:**
```bash
# Debug tee functionality
# Check: src/components/bags/BagCompositeCard.tsx
# Verify Supabase RLS policies for bag_tees table
```

**Solution:**
- Check onClick handler for tee button
- Verify Supabase mutations:
  ```typescript
  // Should insert/delete from bag_tees table
  const handleTee = async () => {
    // Check if this is properly wired
  }
  ```
- Check RLS policies allow authenticated users to:
  - INSERT into bag_tees
  - DELETE from bag_tees where user_id matches
- Add error logging to identify failures

**Verification:**
- Tee count increments/decrements
- UI updates immediately (optimistic update)
- Persists after refresh
- Works on feed, profile, and bag browser
