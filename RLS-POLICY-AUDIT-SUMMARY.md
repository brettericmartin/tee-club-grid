## RLS Policy Analysis

### Current Policy Structure
Based on SQL file analysis, the current policies likely follow these patterns:

1. **Main Pattern**: `"public_read"` for SELECT operations
2. **Legacy Patterns**: Various descriptive names like:
   - `"Anyone can view [table]"`
   - `"Users can [action] [object]"`
   - `"Authenticated users can [action]"`

### Known Policy Names by Table

#### feed_likes (most complex - multiple policy generations)
- `"public_read"`
- `"Anyone can view feed likes"`
- `"Authenticated users can add likes"`
- `"Users can remove their likes"`
- `"Users can view all likes"`
- `"Users can like posts"`
- `"Users can unlike posts"`
- Plus 15+ legacy variations

#### feed_posts
- `"public_read"`
- `"Anyone can view posts"`
- `"Users can create posts"`
- `"Users can update their posts"`
- `"Users can delete their posts"`

#### profiles
- `"public_read"`
- `"Public profiles are viewable by everyone"`
- `"Users can insert their own profile"`
- `"Users can update own profile"`

#### user_follows
- `"public_read"`
- `"Users can view all follows"`
- `"Authenticated users can follow"`
- `"Users can unfollow"`

#### equipment
- `"public_read"`
- `"Equipment is viewable by everyone"`
- `"Authenticated users can add equipment"`

#### equipment_photos
- `"public_read"`
- `"Anyone can view equipment photos"`
- `"Authenticated users can upload photos"`

#### user_bags
- `"public_read"`
- `"Bags are viewable by everyone"`
- `"Users can create their own bags"`
- `"Users can update their own bags"`

#### bag_equipment
- `"public_read"`
- `"Bag equipment is viewable by everyone"`
- `"Users can manage equipment in their bags"`

#### equipment_saves (private)
- `"private_to_user"`

#### equipment_tees
- `"public_read"`
- `"Anyone can view equipment tees"`
- `"Authenticated users can tee equipment"`
- `"Users can untee equipment"`

#### bag_tees
- `"public_read"`
- `"Anyone can view bag tees"`
- `"Authenticated users can tee bags"`
- `"Users can untee bags"`

#### Other tables
Most follow the simple `"public_read"` pattern.

## Recommended Action

### 1. Comprehensive Cleanup
Use the provided SQL file: `sql/drop-all-rls-policies-comprehensive.sql`

This will remove ALL existing policies using every possible name variant found in the codebase.

### 2. Apply Fresh Policies
After cleanup, apply the standardized policies from: `sql/fix-rls-public-read-FINAL.sql`

### 3. Verification
The cleanup script includes verification queries to confirm all policies were removed.

## Files Created

1. **`sql/drop-all-rls-policies-comprehensive.sql`** - Complete cleanup script
2. **`scripts/get-exact-policy-names.js`** - Policy discovery script  
3. **`scripts/get-rls-policies.js`** - Table verification script
4. **This summary document**

## Command to Execute

```bash
# Run in Supabase SQL Editor:
# 1. First run the comprehensive cleanup
# 2. Then apply the FINAL policy set
```

## Key Findings

1. **Multiple Policy Generations**: The `feed_likes` table has accumulated 20+ policy variants from different iterations
2. **Consistent Current Pattern**: Most recent policies use `"public_read"` naming
3. **All Tables Exist**: No missing tables that would cause errors
4. **Ready for Cleanup**: Comprehensive DROP statements prepared to handle all variations

The "policy already exists" errors were caused by multiple overlapping policy names from different script iterations. The comprehensive cleanup will resolve this completely.
