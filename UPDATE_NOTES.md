# Update Notes - December 19, 2025

### Critical Performance Fix
- **Fixed hanging Supabase count queries** - Removed `head: true` parameter from all count queries which was causing requests to hang indefinitely

- Now using minimal field selection (`id`) for count-only queries

### Feed Improvements
- **Fixed bag card display in feed** - Properly fetches and displays bag data with equipment photos
- **Fixed equipment photo processing** - Added proper photo URL resolution for feed cards
- **Fixed bag likes** - Separate tracking for bag likes vs post likes
