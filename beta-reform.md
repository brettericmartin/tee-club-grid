# Beta Waitlist & Referral System Audit - Teed.club

## Executive Summary
Current implementation is a mistaken external API access program that needs correction to a proper beta USER waitlist + referral system with visible demand-supply tension (Daniel Priestley style).

### API Endpoints

#### `/api/waitlist/submit` (POST)
- Handles waitlist form submissions
- Scoring system (0-100 points based on answers)
- Auto-approval for high scores if capacity available
- Invite code validation
- Honeypot protection
- Rate limiting (10/min, burst 30)
- Email confirmation check for authenticated users

#### `/api/beta/redeem` (POST) - **AUTHENTICATED**
- Redeems invite codes for authenticated users
- Atomic operations with optimistic locking
- Grants beta access + 3 invites
- Tracks referrer's invites_used

#### `/api/beta/summary` (GET) - **PUBLIC**
- Returns beta statistics:
  - Current capacity and usage
  - Active vs total users (soft delete aware)
  - Waitlist count
  - Public beta status
- 1-minute cache

#### `/api/waitlist/approve` (POST) - **ADMIN ONLY**
- Manually approve waitlist applications
- Sends approval emails with invite codes

### Frontend Components

#### Auth Guards
- **`BetaGuard`** (`/src/components/auth/BetaGuard.tsx`)
  - Protects routes requiring beta access
  - Checks feature_flags.public_beta_enabled
  - Grants access to admins automatically
  - 5-minute cache for feature flags
  - Currently only protects `/my-bag` route

- **`AdminGuard`** (`/src/components/auth/AdminGuard.tsx`)
  - Protects admin routes
  - Checks profile.is_admin

#### Waitlist UI
- **`WaitlistPage`** (`/src/pages/Waitlist.tsx`)
  - Main waitlist landing page
  - Captures invite codes from URL params
  - Stores codes in localStorage for later redemption
  - Shows success states after submission

- **`WaitlistForm`** (`/src/components/waitlist/WaitlistForm.tsx`)
  - Multi-question application form
  - Honeypot field protection
  - Terms acceptance required

- **`WaitlistBanner`** (`/src/components/waitlist/WaitlistBanner.tsx`)
  - Live counter showing spots remaining
  - Fetches from `/api/beta/summary`

- **`WaitlistAdmin`** (`/src/pages/admin/WaitlistAdmin.tsx`)
  - Admin dashboard for managing applications
  - Filtering, sorting, bulk actions
  - Manual approval/rejection

### Utility Systems

#### Referral Capture (`/src/utils/referralCapture.ts`)
- Captures URL params: `?code=`, `?invite=`, `?ref=`, `?referral=`
- Stores in localStorage for post-auth redemption
- 30-day expiration
- Auto-cleans URL after capture

#### Scoring System (`/src/lib/waitlist.ts`)
- Point allocation:
  - Role (player/coach/pro): 20-40 points
  - Sharing frequency: 0-15 points
  - Equipment spending: 5-15 points
  - Social channels: 5-10 points
  - Location (major cities): 5 points
  - Invite code: +20 bonus
- Auto-approval threshold: 75+ points

### Environment Variables
- `VITE_SUPABASE_URL` - Supabase project URL
- `VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` - Public anon key
- `SUPABASE_SERVICE_KEY` - Service role key (server-side only)

## Risk Mitigation

### Privacy Concerns
- Hash emails in logs
- Allow anonymous referrals
- GDPR-compliant data handling
- Clear data retention policies

### Spam Prevention
- Rate limiting on all endpoints
- Honeypot fields in forms
- Email verification required
- IP-based abuse detection

### Scalability
- Database connection pooling
- Redis caching for counters
- CDN for static assets
- Queue system for emails

## Implementation Priority

**MUST HAVE (P0)**
- Expand route protection
- Generate referral codes
- Basic invite dashboard
- Waitlist position display

**SHOULD HAVE (P1)**
- Public leaderboard
- Email notifications
- Social sharing
- Queue jumping

**NICE TO HAVE (P2)**
- Advanced analytics
- A/B testing
- Automated campaigns
- Gamification badges

## Conclusion

The current system has solid foundations but lacks the viral mechanics and visibility needed for a Priestley-style waitlist. The recommended changes will create genuine scarcity, social proof, and referral incentives while maintaining the existing scoring and approval logic.

Key success factor: Make the waitlist itself a desirable product through gamification, community, and visible progress toward access.
