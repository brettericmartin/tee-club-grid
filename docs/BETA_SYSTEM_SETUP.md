### Launch Day

1. Announce beta program on social media
2. Share invite codes with select users
3. Monitor waitlist submissions via admin tool
4. Approve users in waves based on score

## How It Works

### User Flow
1. User visits `/waitlist` and sees live capacity (e.g., "47/150 spots filled")
2. Fills out comprehensive application form
3. System calculates score based on:
   - Role (content creator, pro, enthusiast)
   - Handicap level
   - Equipment interest
   - Community involvement
   - Purchase intent
4. If score ‚â• 75: Auto-approved with immediate access
5. If score < 75: Added to waitlist queue
6. Approved users can immediately build their bag

### Admin Flow
1. Run `node scripts/beta-admin.js`
2. View real-time beta status
3. Approve users manually or by score threshold
4. Adjust beta cap as needed
5. Generate invite codes for special users

## Transparency Metrics

The system provides full visibility into:
- **Demand**: Total applications, pending queue size
- **Supply**: Beta cap, spots remaining
- **Urgency**: Color-coded banners (green ‚Üí yellow ‚Üí orange ‚Üí red)
- **Social Proof**: Recent approvals ticker, referral leaderboard
- **Fair Access**: Score-based queue, visible criteria

## Security Features

- Row Level Security on all user-generated content
- Beta access required for creating:
  - Bags
  - Feed posts
  - Equipment photos
  - Follows
- Honeypot fields for bot detection
- Rate limiting on submissions
- Email verification checks

## Next Steps

1. **Test in Production**: Deploy and test with small group
2. **Email Setup**: Configure transactional emails
3. **Marketing**: Prepare launch announcement
4. **Monitoring**: Set up analytics dashboards
5. **Scaling**: Plan for capacity increases

- `scripts/beta-admin.js` - Admin interface
- `scripts/verify-beta-cycle.js` - System verification

## Troubleshooting

**Issue**: Waitlist form shows "Development mode"

**Issue**: Beta summary not updating
**Solution**: Check feature_flags table has id=1 record
