## Core Principles

### Universal Rules:
1. **Public Read by Default**: Most content should be viewable by everyone (anon + authenticated)
2. **Authenticated Write**: Only logged-in users can create/modify content
3. **Owner-Only Updates**: Users can only modify their own content
4. **Cascade Through Relationships**: Use EXISTS clauses for ownership verification through foreign keys

### Policy Structure Template:
```sql
-- Enable RLS
ALTER TABLE table_name ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;

-- Public read
CREATE POLICY "Anyone can view" ON table_name
  FOR SELECT USING (true);

-- Authenticated insert
CREATE POLICY "Authenticated can insert" ON table_name
  FOR INSERT WITH CHECK (auth.uid() IS NOT NULL);

-- Owner update/delete
CREATE POLICY "Owners can update" ON table_name
  FOR UPDATE USING (user_id = auth.uid());
```

---

## User & Profile Tables

### `profiles`
**Purpose**: User profile information

-- UPDATE: Users update their own profile
USING (auth.uid() = id)
WITH CHECK (auth.uid() = id)

-- DELETE: Not allowed (profiles should never be deleted)
```

## Admin & System Tables

## Common Patterns

### 1. Ownership Through Foreign Key
When a table doesn't have direct `user_id`, check ownership through related table:
```sql
EXISTS (
  SELECT 1 FROM parent_table
  WHERE parent_table.id = child_table.parent_id
  AND parent_table.user_id = auth.uid()
)
```

### 2. Public/Private Toggle
For tables with visibility settings:
```sql
-- SELECT policy
USING (is_public = true OR user_id = auth.uid())
```

### 3. Admin Override
For admin access to all rows:
```sql
USING (
  user_id = auth.uid()
  OR EXISTS (SELECT 1 FROM profiles WHERE id = auth.uid() AND is_admin = true)
)
```

### 4. Soft Delete Pattern
Instead of DELETE policies, use status field:
```sql
-- UPDATE policy for soft delete
USING (user_id = auth.uid())
WITH CHECK (user_id = auth.uid() AND status = 'deleted')
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues & Solutions

1. **"new row violates row-level security policy"**
   - User is not authenticated
   - WITH CHECK condition is failing
   - Foreign key relationship doesn't exist

2. **Can see data but can't modify**
   - Check UPDATE/DELETE policies
   - Verify ownership conditions
   - Check if auth.uid() matches user_id

3. **No data visible when there should be**
   - Check SELECT policy
   - Verify RLS is enabled on table
   - Check if user is authenticated when required

4. **Can't add equipment to bag**
   - Verify bag ownership first
   - Check bag_equipment INSERT policy
   - Ensure equipment exists

### Testing Checklist
- [ ] Anonymous users can view public content
- [ ] Authenticated users can create content
- [ ] Users can only modify their own content
- [ ] Admin overrides work correctly
- [ ] Foreign key relationships are validated

### Emergency Fixes
If RLS is completely broken:
1. Use the master SQL file: `/supabase/migrations/20250110_master_rls_policies.sql`
2. Run verification script: `node scripts/verify-all-rls.js`
3. Check this reference sheet for correct policies

## Maintenance Notes

- **Last Full Audit**: 2025-01-10
- **Critical Tables**: equipment, bag_equipment, user_bags (most user-facing issues)
- **Never Disable RLS**: Always fix policies instead of disabling RLS
- **Test Changes**: Use verification script after any RLS modifications

---

## SQL Generation Template

For each table, use this template:
```sql
-- Table: [table_name]
ALTER TABLE [table_name] ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;

-- Drop existing policies
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "[policy_name]" ON [table_name];

-- Create new policies
CREATE POLICY "[descriptive_name]" 
ON [table_name] 
FOR [SELECT|INSERT|UPDATE|DELETE] 
USING ([condition])
WITH CHECK ([condition]);

-- Grant permissions
GRANT SELECT ON [table_name] TO anon, authenticated;
GRANT INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE ON [table_name] TO authenticated;
```
