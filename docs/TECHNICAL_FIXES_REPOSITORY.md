## Notes for Future Development

### Pending Issues to Monitor
1. Glassmorphism performance on mobile devices
2. Large image optimization (dog.png, MYBAG.png)
3. Feed infinite scroll performance
4. Real-time features scaling

### Best Practices Established
1. Always use lazy auth initialization
2. Implement proper error boundaries
3. Use React optimization hooks (memo, useMemo, useCallback)
4. Server-side pagination for large datasets
5. Proper TypeScript types for all Supabase queries

### Lessons Learned
1. Tab switching auth is complex - keep it simple
2. RLS policies can cause infinite recursion - test thoroughly
3. Vercel hobby plan has strict limits - optimize accordingly
4. Dynamic imports need fallbacks in production
5. Always test on actual mobile devices, not just responsive mode
