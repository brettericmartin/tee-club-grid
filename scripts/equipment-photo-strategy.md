# Equipment Photo Collection Strategy

## Current Situation
All automated approaches have failed due to anti-bot measures:
1. ❌ Puppeteer screenshots - blocked by websites
2. ❌ Google Images - blocked
3. ❌ Direct scraping - blocked
4. ❌ 2nd Swing specific - blocked
5. ❌ Amazon direct URLs - 404 errors

## Recommended Solutions

### Option 1: Community-Sourced Images (Recommended)
- Let users upload equipment photos when they add items to their bags
- Implement a "missing photo" indicator that encourages uploads
- First user to upload a good photo gets a badge/points
- Photos are reviewed and become the default for that equipment

### Option 2: Manual Collection
- Use the UnifiedPhotoUploadDialog component you already have
- Admin manually uploads photos for popular equipment
- Start with top 50-100 most popular items

### Option 3: Official APIs
- Contact manufacturers for API access
- TaylorMade, Callaway, Titleist often have B2B programs
- Requires business relationships but provides high-quality images

### Option 4: Stock Photo Services
- Use golf equipment stock photos from services like:
  - Shutterstock
  - Getty Images
  - Adobe Stock
- Requires licensing but guaranteed to work

### Option 5: AI-Generated Placeholders
- Use AI to generate placeholder images for equipment
- Not actual photos but better than nothing
- Can be replaced with real photos later

## Implementation Priority
1. Add "Upload Photo" button for equipment without images
2. Implement photo moderation queue
3. Add gamification (badges/points) for photo contributions
4. Create admin tool for bulk manual uploads
5. Track which equipment needs photos most urgently

## Technical Implementation
The infrastructure is already in place:
- ✅ Storage bucket configured
- ✅ Upload components exist
- ✅ Database structure ready
- Just need to connect user uploads to equipment records
