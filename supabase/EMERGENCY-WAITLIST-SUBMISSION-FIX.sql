-- ====================================================================
-- EMERGENCY FIX: Allow Public Waitlist Application Submission
-- ====================================================================
-- This fixes the critical issue preventing users from submitting applications
-- ====================================================================

-- First, check if RLS is enabled
DO $$
BEGIN
    RAISE NOTICE 'Checking RLS status on waitlist_applications...';
END $$;

-- Drop all existing policies to start fresh
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Anyone can submit waitlist application" ON waitlist_applications;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can view their own applications" ON waitlist_applications;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Service role bypasses waitlist RLS" ON waitlist_applications;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Service role full access" ON waitlist_applications;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Admins can view all applications" ON waitlist_applications;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Admins can update applications" ON waitlist_applications;

-- Create simple, clear policies

-- 1. CRITICAL: Allow ANYONE (including anonymous users) to INSERT
CREATE POLICY "Public can submit applications"
    ON waitlist_applications
    FOR INSERT
    TO public, anon, authenticated
    WITH CHECK (true);  -- No restrictions on submission

-- 2. Users can view their own applications
CREATE POLICY "Users view own applications"
    ON waitlist_applications
    FOR SELECT
    TO authenticated
    USING (
        -- User can see their own applications by email
        auth.jwt() ->> 'email' = email

            SELECT 1 FROM admins 
            WHERE user_id = auth.uid()
        )
    );

-- 3. Service role bypasses everything (for API operations)
CREATE POLICY "Service role bypass"
    ON waitlist_applications
    FOR ALL
    TO service_role
    USING (true)
    WITH CHECK (true);

-- 4. Only admins can update/delete

    ON waitlist_applications
    FOR UPDATE
    TO authenticated
    USING (
        EXISTS (
            SELECT 1 FROM admins
